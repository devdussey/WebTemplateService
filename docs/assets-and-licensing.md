# Assets and Licensing

The assets bundled with this template are intentionally neutral so buyers can replace them with brand-approved material.

| Asset | Location | Source | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Logo placeholder | public/logo.svg | Created for this template | Replace with your own brand mark before launch. |
| Favicon | public/favicon.png | Generated programmatically for this package | Swap with a 180x180 PNG that matches your brand. |
| Preview cover | preview/cover.png | Generated for this package | Update the copy/imagery before submitting to Envato. |
| Preview thumbnail | preview/thumbnail.png | Generated for this package | Update the copy/imagery before submitting to Envato. |

No third-party fonts or stock photos are included. Tailwind CSS uses system fonts by default, and the hero/about sections rely on CSS gradients until you supply licensed imagery.

Document any new assets you add and keep their licenses in your submission zip so Envato reviewers can verify usage rights.
